### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
I'm Andrew Valoviy, a Python developer from Ukrain. Here's a bit about me:

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Telegram bot programming in Golang.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning DevOps and Kubernetes.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on development and deployment of sites, including using LLM models.
- ğŸ¤” I'm looking for help with soft architecture bulding.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about Deep Learning, AI and LLMs.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: valoviy@gmail.com
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: At first, I learned to be a backend developer, but it turned out that devops engineering is more interesting to me.
